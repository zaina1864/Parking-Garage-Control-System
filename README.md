# Parking-Garage-Control-System
A VHDL-based FPGA project that uses ultrasonic sensors to track vehicle entry/exit in a parking garage. Features LED indicators for entry, exit, and full capacity, along with a real-time car count on a 7-segment display. Designed for efficient traffic flow, automated monitoring, and real-time system feedback on Cyclone V FPGA.
